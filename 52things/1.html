<h2>52 Things People Should Know To Do Cryptography</h2>

<h3>What is this?</h3>
Cryptography is a highly interdiscplinary area; calling on 
expertise in Pure Mathematics, Computer Science and Electronic
Engineering.
At Bristol we cover the full range of these topics and as
such our students come with a variety of backgrounds and
need to understand a diverse range of topics.
Students starting can often feel overwhelmed by the types of
knowledge that they feel they need to know; not knowing
what they need to remember and what they should not bother
remembering.

<p>

To aid you, below we have collected a set of 52 short points
of things we think that at the end of the first year of a
PhD all students should have some familiarity with. 
There is one point for every week of the year.
If you know these things then following seminars, study groups 
and conference talks will be much easier.
It will also help in putting your own work into context.
Some of these are somewhat advanced topics, some of these
are what one would pick up in certain undergraduate courses.
This is deliberate since some are about being a cryptographer,
and some are to address the fact that students start with
different backgrounds. 

</p><p>

If at the end of the first year you know the answers to
ninety percent of the things we list then you should find
that you will get more out of the conferences and talks
you attend in your second year. In addition it will be
easier to talk to cryptographers (who may be future
employers) from other institutions since you will be able 
to converse with them using a common language.
Almost all of the following are discussed in our
undergraduate cryptography courses.

</p><p>
By each section we give a reference to places where the
definitions can be found, or where to start your reading.
The list of references can be found at the bottom.
Not all answers can be found in the references cited,
but they should give you a place to start looking.

<h3>Further Reading</h3>

<ul>
<li>[A] <a href="./[A].pdf">Nigel's book</a>
    is deliberately informal and tries to give quick flavours of 
    what is important in theory and practice.
</li><li>[B] The <a href="./[B].pdf">Katz Lindell book</a> 
    is a better formal introduction to modern theoretical cryptography
    but it is less good in its treatment of what is important in

    is quite limited).
</li><li>[C] Goldreich's two volume book(<a href="./[C1].pdf">I</a>, <a href="./[C2].pdf">II</a>)
    is a very good introduction to the deep theory, but deliberately does

    is the best introduction to all things about side-channels.
